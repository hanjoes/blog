<p>This is a required response on the assigned reading of in CS686.<br>After reading the preface I realized that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Visualization-Analysis-Design-AK-Peters/dp/1466508914/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454378728&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Tamara+Munzer" target="_blank" rel="external">this book</a> is really worth reading, at least for someone like me that doesn’t have any former experience in Data Visualization.</p>
<h2 id="Something-About-the-Book"><a href="#Something-About-the-Book" class="headerlink" title="Something About the Book"></a>Something About the Book</h2><p>Before this book, if you want to learn Data Visualization you have basically two choices. First is you could dive right into academic papers, and as said by <a href="http://cs.usfca.edu/~apjoshi/" target="_blank" rel="external">Alark</a>, those papers assume you knows a lot in the field. So the learning curve becomes very steep although the things you read is really “fresh” and you know right away where the idea originates from (may not be useful but sometimes makes me feel its more trust-worthy). Another way is to read some book that’s related to Data Visualization, like some Computer Graphics books, which don’t really talk about Data Visualization systematically, or some other books that really focused on the foundation of Data Visualization (the “from bottom to top way” as described by Tamara Munzner).</p>
<p>Neither of the two ways of learning gives readers enough insights with which they can use immediately into the projects they care about. And that’s the reason for the VAD book. Which focuses on the patterns &amp; frameworks that help readers make the right design decisions and, even more, with those higher level concepts in mind it would become easier to read those academic papers if the reader wants to dig further.</p>
<h2 id="Something-About-Chapter-1"><a href="#Something-About-Chapter-1" class="headerlink" title="Something About Chapter 1"></a>Something About Chapter 1</h2><p>The first chapter of this book is really explaining what is Data Visualization. The author starts from a fairly abstract definition of “vis” (I will start to use this phrase from now on since it’s adopted by the author) and asking potential questions on the definition. Instead of writing a list that rephrases the things the author described in the chapter. I want to talk a little about something that really enlightened me.</p>
<p>In Chapter 1.2, when the author is trying to explain human’s role with the vis tool, she mentioned that the “many kinds of uses” of a vis tool which can be for both transitional use or for long-term use. This indeed opened up my mind about tooling in a large project, and possible usage of vis tools.</p>
<p>A simplest example is when we are writing a small project at school, most of the time we will print out debug information. Well, this is a primitive kind of visualization, which is not a “good” visualization simply because it doesn’t scale.</p>
<p>When the project gets larger, the time spent on tooling should grow respectively. And building a vis system sometimes is as important as implementing new features or even writing unit tests and integration tests. A great example is a monitoring system. It could be used not only for preventing regression introduced by adding new features or refactoring, but it sometimes can give out hidden patterns that will cause major crash. Just think of an unusual high I/O wait on your server, which sometimes is not sensible by your user but it could potentially hiding some defect in your HDD which will result in a total disaster in the near future.</p>
<p>With that said, a decent understanding in building good vis tools is very important not only for practitioners, but also for those who work in other fields that is related to complicated systems.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/hansrosling.png" alt="Hans Rosling &quot;Casting&quot; Data"></p>
<p>I feel really lucky that I had the chance to watch this talk. Before that <strong>I never got</strong> Data Visualization.</p>
<p>Why is every body talking about it or how come people create a new discipline for something that’s really depending on intuition.</p>
<p>In this talk, Hans Rosling was like a wizard, whose magic is to manipulate visual elements to convey critical information or trends to his audience. I did’t get to it until I saw the pictures that all the lovely flowers grew on the soil with raw data embedded in it. But <strong>data</strong> is Hans Roling’s mojo (of course with his knowledge and experience in this field.).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/ExMachinaCast.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="What-if-you-discovered-oil-before-you-invented-the-internal-combustion-engine"><a href="#What-if-you-discovered-oil-before-you-invented-the-internal-combustion-engine" class="headerlink" title="What if you discovered oil before you invented the internal combustion engine?"></a>What if you discovered oil before you invented the internal combustion engine?</h3><p>The realization of that the data is the raw material which could be exploited and be used in some greater course, is no less than the invention of the combustion engine as inferred from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1209966/" target="_blank" rel="external">Oscar Isaac</a>‘s remark in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ex Machina</a>.</p>
<p>Given that analogy, learning Data Visualization is more like learning technologies that build more efficient and more powerful engines. And for us computer science students or researchers, our duty is to practice and invent better tools that can help people build data visualization apps either used for a specific requirement or serve as a general framework that people use in a kind of situations.</p>
<p>At the end, please allow me to use another screenshot from Hans Roslings talk to remind me what we can do, and what we can achieve in the future.</p>

<p>Good visualization can let people communicate much faster and easier, yet there are still some pieces of works that slows people down, or even worse, it could communicate the wrong information.</p>
<p>Here we will look at two examples that show us both good and bad visualizations.</p>
<h3 id="Good-Example"><a href="#Good-Example" class="headerlink" title="Good Example"></a>Good Example</h3><p>Below is a graph describing race distribution in U.S. The original graph can be accessed from <a href="http://demographics.coopercenter.org/DotMap/" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.<br>I think this graph is a <strong>good</strong> data visualization for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It uses the actual United States map that make the data in the visualization more intuitive. Anyone who has a little geographic sense about U.S. will know how to interpret the data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This data visualization uses the raw data in the “right way”. Which means it gives the raw data meaning that can let people find the underlying pattern. For example, if you are given a HUGE list of race-address information in text form, you will never figure out that black folks are distributed in the south and east parts of the country, but with this graph, you will know it at the first glance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/blog/images/census_dot_map.png" alt="The Racial Dot Map: One Dot Per Person for the Entire U.S."></p>
<h3 id="Bad-Example"><a href="#Bad-Example" class="headerlink" title="Bad Example"></a>Bad Example</h3><p>A bad visualization is usually some graph that communicates the wrong idea, or express the data in a wrong way. This one reminds us that the visual elements of a visualization is not trivial since it could plant the wrong information into the reader’s mind.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/wtf_data_viz.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are at least two problems with this graph.</p>
<p>First the three numbers doesn’t sum up to 100%, but that could be okay because there might be some context that we don’t know (like the classification of races mentioned in the graph.)</p>
<p>Another, which is more important, problem in this graph is that, the bars don’t work with the numbers (African American’s bar is way longer than the other two races while it’s percentage is smaller.). Although it’s possible that the author of this graph doesn’t intend to express the ration using the “bar”, but anyways, the graph still gives us an illusion that the African American portion has the biggest ratio.</p>
