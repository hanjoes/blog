# README

This is a small project to get familiar with [P5.js](http://p5js.org/). As mentioned, the only purpose of the code here is to display a specific dataset (U.S. Presidents rating from 1945 - 1974 in this case.).

Implemented features are as following:
1. Showing the same dataset using bar chart, stacked bar chart, scatterplot, line graph and box plot.
2. All vis are interactive (highlighting and showing tooltips) except for box plot.
