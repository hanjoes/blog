This chapter basically answers the question of "Why" we want to create a vis tool. The author carefully introduced the language we should use in analyzing and describing the "requirement" of the user. And at the end the author gave us several examples in the field to illustrate how are we going to use the "language" in the chapter to analyze different vis tools. This chapter serves as the very basis that we should at least be aware of in future when we are building vis tools.
