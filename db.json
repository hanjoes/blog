There are several design points we can consider according to the book. More specifically they are value arrangement, region arrangement, axis orientation and layout density.\n\nDifferent design points focus on some specific requirement, e,g., a bar chart make comparison much easier and also focus on the feasibility, e.g., scatterplot is most suitable for two-value tables.\n\n## Interesting Point\n\nThe concept that's quite new to me is the introduction of heatmaps. Although I have seen heatmap almost everyday, I didn't know anything about it. Below is one of my favorite heatmap:\n\n![Github Activity Indicator](/blog/images/githubactivity.png)\n\nHeatmaps are mainly used to encode data that has two key attributes which usually are ordinal or categorical.

There are several design points we can consider according to the book. More specifically they are value arrangement, region arrangement, axis orientation and layout density.\n\nDifferent design points focus on some specific requirement, e,g., a bar chart make comparison much easier and also focus on the feasibility, e.g., scatterplot is most suitable for two-value tables.\n\n## Interesting Point\n\nThe concept that's quite new to me is the introduction of heatmaps.

First is you could dive right into academic papers, and as said by [Alark](http://cs.usfca.edu/~apjoshi/), those papers assume you knows a lot in the field. So the learning curve becomes very steep although the things you read is really \"fresh\" and you know right away where the idea originates from (may not be useful but sometimes makes me feel its more trust-worthy). Another way is to read some book that's related to Data Visualization, like some Computer Graphics books, which don't really talk about Data Visualization systematically, or some other books that really focused on the foundation of Data Visualization (the \"from bottom to top way\" as described by Tamara Munzner).\n\nNeither of the two ways of learning gives readers enough insights with which they can use immediately into the projects they care about. And that's the reason for the VAD book. Which focuses on the patterns & frameworks that help readers make the right design decisions and, even more, with those higher level concepts in mind it would become easier to read those academic papers if the reader wants to dig further.\n\n## Something About Chapter 1\n\nThe first chapter of this book is really explaining what is Data Visualization. The author starts from a fairly abstract definition of \"vis\" (I will start to use this phrase from now on since it's adopted by the author) and asking potential questions on the definition. Instead of writing a list that rephrases the things the author described in the chapter. I want to talk a little about something that really enlightened me.\n\nIn Chapter 1.2, when the author is trying to explain human's role with the vis tool, she mentioned that the \"many kinds of uses\" of a vis tool which can be for both transitional use or for long-term use. This indeed opened up my mind about tooling in a large project, and possible usage of vis tools.\n\nA simplest example is when we are writing a small project at school, most of the time we will print out debug information. Well, this is a primitive kind of visualization, which is not a \"good\" visualization simply because it doesn't scale.\n\nWhen the project gets larger, the time spent on tooling should grow respectively. And building a vis system sometimes is as important as implementing new features or even writing unit tests and integration tests. A great example is a monitoring system. It could be used not only for preventing regression introduced by adding new features or refactoring, but it sometimes can give out hidden patterns that will cause major crash. Just think of an unusual high I/O wait on your server, which sometimes is not sensible by your user but it could potentially hiding some defect in your HDD which will result in a total disaster in the near future.\n\nWith that said, a decent understanding in building good vis tools is very important not only for practitioners, but also for those who work in other fields that is related to complicated systems.\n","source":"_posts/Response-on-Chapter-1-of-the-VAD-book-by-Tamara-Munzner.md","raw":"title: Response on Chapter 1 of the VAD Book by Tamara Munzner\ndate: 2016-02-01 17:59:21\ncategories:\n- Computer Science\n- Data Visualization\ntags:\n- Assignments\n- Reviews\n---\n\n![Cover of Visualization Analysis & Design by Tamara Munzner](/blog/images/VADfront.png)\n\nThis is a required response on the assigned reading of in CS686.\nAfter reading the preface I realized that [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Visualization-Analysis-Design-AK-Peters/dp/1466508914/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1454378728&sr=8-1&keywords=Tamara+Munzer) is really worth reading, at least for someone like me that doesn't have any former experience in Data Visualization.\n\n## Something About the Book\n\nBefore this book, if you want to learn Data Visualization you have basically two choices.

There are so many things I want to build while so little time left before starting the mundane life as a \"coding monkey\" (Chinese word for software practitioners since in Chinese the word for programmer sounds like the monkey who writes code. Kind of like nerd used in English.). During the past two weeks I was coding day and night without too much time reading blogs or surfing online. While today when I finally opened up my Pinterest board, there is this cool data vis came into my sight. And the name for it is \"Strength of Nations\".\n\nThe reason it caught my eye first is that it **looks good**. The combination of the colors used on the parchment forms a kind of harmony. Another example of a similar color usage is [here](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). But some further reading revealed that this is actually a pretty decent vis in technical aspects. As we can see each node represents scientific publications in a particular topic, while the links shows publications that explore more than one topic or interdisciplinary researches. This vis tool not only makes it very easy to locate and query a single topic but also gives a clear emphasis on the relationships between different disciplines. For the screenshot we know immediately United States has a significant numbers of papers in the social sciences and medical sciences and also has strong interdisciplinary researches pertain to Biochemistry. And from the screenshot below showing the comparison of countries, we can acquire the likelihood of emphasis on different areas of research and by the first look we know that China and Taiwan have very similar research focuses.\n\n![Strength of Nations](/blog/images/strengthofnations.png)\n","source":"_posts/Cool-Vis-Weekly-Report-1.md","raw":"title: 'Cool Vis Weekly Report #1'\ndate: 2016-02-08 23:17:07\nCategory:\n- Computer Science\n- Data Visualization\ntags:\n- Assignments\n- Reviews\n---\n\n![Strength of Nations](/blog/images/sonus.png)\n\nTime flew by, now is the beginning of the 3rd week of my last semester. There are so many things I want to build while so little time left before starting the mundane life as a \"coding monkey\" (Chinese word for software practitioners since in Chinese the word for programmer sounds like the monkey who writes code. Kind of like nerd used in English.). During the past two weeks I was coding day and night without too much time reading blogs or surfing online. While today when I finally opened up my Pinterest board, there is this cool data vis came into my sight. And the name for it is \"Strength of Nations\".\n\nThe reason it caught my eye first is that it **looks good**. The combination of the colors used on the parchment forms a kind of harmony. Another example of a similar color usage is [here](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). But some further reading revealed that this is actually a pretty decent vis in technical aspects. As we can see each node represents scientific publications in a particular topic, while the links shows publications that explore more than one topic or interdisciplinary researches. This vis tool not only makes it very easy to locate and query a single topic but also gives a clear emphasis on the relationships between different disciplines. For the screenshot we know immediately United States has a significant numbers of papers in the social sciences and medical sciences and also has strong interdisciplinary researches pertain to Biochemistry.
