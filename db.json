So I did it. And immediately it gives me a tooltip not only showing the dimension data, but also the extra attribute I just drag-and-dropped. And we can easily know that the three countries are (from left to right), Afghanistan, Saudi.Arabia and Libya and all of them are oil exporting countries! I'm not going to talk about world politics but the correlation to oil may reveal something.\n\n### Infant mortality and income according to regions.\n![Mortality-Region](images/infantmortality2.png)\n\nBy comparing infant mortality and income according to regions we easily know that Europe is the wealthiest and has lowest infant mortality, while Africa is in the reversed case. But Asia is not as wealthy as America but has lower infant mortality. Presumably the reason is that although Asia is not as economically strong as America countries, but by that time most countries in Asia is in a more stable state than their peers in some of the American countries. But to verify this point we need some other data support.\n\n# Wife Working Hours\n\nThis data demonstrates the working hours of the wife in United States families.

First is you could dive right into academic papers, and as said by [Alark](http://cs.usfca.edu/~apjoshi/), those papers assume you knows a lot in the field. So the learning curve becomes very steep although the things you read is really \"fresh\" and you know right away where the idea originates from (may not be useful but sometimes makes me feel its more trust-worthy). Another way is to read some book that's related to Data Visualization, like some Computer Graphics books, which don't really talk about Data Visualization systematically, or some other books that really focused on the foundation of Data Visualization (the \"from bottom to top way\" as described by Tamara Munzner).\n\nNeither of the two ways of learning gives readers enough insights with which they can use immediately into the projects they care about. And that's the reason for the VAD book. Which focuses on the patterns & frameworks that help readers make the right design decisions and, even more, with those higher level concepts in mind it would become easier to read those academic papers if the reader wants to dig further.\n\n## Something About Chapter 1\n\nThe first chapter of this book is really explaining what is Data Visualization. The author starts from a fairly abstract definition of \"vis\" (I will start to use this phrase from now on since it's adopted by the author) and asking potential questions on the definition. Instead of writing a list that rephrases the things the author described in the chapter. I want to talk a little about something that really enlightened me.\n\nIn Chapter 1.2, when the author is trying to explain human's role with the vis tool, she mentioned that the \"many kinds of uses\" of a vis tool which can be for both transitional use or for long-term use. This indeed opened up my mind about tooling in a large project, and possible usage of vis tools.\n\nA simplest example is when we are writing a small project at school, most of the time we will print out debug information. Well, this is a primitive kind of visualization, which is not a \"good\" visualization simply because it doesn't scale.\n\nWhen the project gets larger, the time spent on tooling should grow respectively. And building a vis system sometimes is as important as implementing new features or even writing unit tests and integration tests. A great example is a monitoring system.

First is you could dive right into academic papers, and as said by [Alark](http://cs.usfca.edu/~apjoshi/), those papers assume you knows a lot in the field. So the learning curve becomes very steep although the things you read is really \"fresh\" and you know right away where the idea originates from (may not be useful but sometimes makes me feel its more trust-worthy). Another way is to read some book that's related to Data Visualization, like some Computer Graphics books, which don't really talk about Data Visualization systematically, or some other books that really focused on the foundation of Data Visualization (the \"from bottom to top way\" as described by Tamara Munzner).\n\nNeither of the two ways of learning gives readers enough insights with which they can use immediately into the projects they care about. And that's the reason for the VAD book. Which focuses on the patterns & frameworks that help readers make the right design decisions and, even more, with those higher level concepts in mind it would become easier to read those academic papers if the reader wants to dig further.\n\n## Something About Chapter 1\n\nThe first chapter of this book is really explaining what is Data Visualization. The author starts from a fairly abstract definition of \"vis\" (I will start to use this phrase from now on since it's adopted by the author) and asking potential questions on the definition. Instead of writing a list that rephrases the things the author described in the chapter. I want to talk a little about something that really enlightened me.\n\nIn Chapter 1.2, when the author is trying to explain human's role with the vis tool, she mentioned that the \"many kinds of uses\" of a vis tool which can be for both transitional use or for long-term use. This indeed opened up my mind about tooling in a large project, and possible usage of vis tools.\n\nA simplest example is when we are writing a small project at school, most of the time we will print out debug information. Well, this is a primitive kind of visualization, which is not a \"good\" visualization simply because it doesn't scale.\n\nWhen the project gets larger, the time spent on tooling should grow respectively. And building a vis system sometimes is as important as implementing new features or even writing unit tests and integration tests. A great example is a monitoring system. It could be used not only for preventing regression introduced by adding new features or refactoring, but it sometimes can give out hidden patterns that will cause major crash. Just think of an unusual high I/O wait on your server, which sometimes is not sensible by your user but it could potentially hiding some defect in your HDD which will result in a total disaster in the near future.\n\nWith that said, a decent understanding in building good vis tools is very important not only for practitioners, but also for those who work in other fields that is related to complicated systems.\n","slug":"Response-on-Chapter-1-of-the-VAD-Book-by-Tamara-Munzner","published":1,"updated":"2016-03-31T20:51:00.000Z","_id":"cimgqalj7000lxgwlrexpckvm","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p><img src=\"images/VADfront.png\" alt=\"Cover of Visualization Analysis &amp; Design by Tamara Munzner\"></p>\n<p>This is a required response on the assigned reading of in CS686.<br>After reading the preface I realized that <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Visualization-Analysis-Design-AK-Peters/dp/1466508914/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454378728&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Tamara+Munzer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">this book</a> is really worth reading, at least for someone like me that doesn’t have any former experience in Data Visualization.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Something-About-the-Book\"><a href=\"#Something-About-the-Book\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Something About the Book\"></a>Something About the Book</h2><p>Before this book, if you want to learn Data Visualization you have basically two choices.

I think it’s the average number of different colors we can store in our human GPU when processing the vis.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Evolve-on-the-Originals\"><a href=\"#Evolve-on-the-Originals\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Evolve on the Originals\"></a>Evolve on the Originals</h2><p>The author also mentioned the idea of aggregating information on a given encoding idiom. My favorite is the use of <strong>glyph</strong> in value encodings. (See the picture below).</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/glyphexample.png\" alt=\"Glyph Example\"></p>\n<p>The scatterplot above uses glyph which is a bigger circle with color to indicate the life expectancy and infant morality for one country. From the graph we can know quickly the country we are looking for, or it speeds up locating and querying by using the term introduced in the book. And if you’ve seen the <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen\">video</a> you will know that the glyph introduces more possibilities for manipulation. The user can break out those bigger circles to get the data points belongs to that country, which is very cool.</p>\n"},{"title":"Response on Chapter 9 of the VAD Book by Tamara Munzner","date":"2016-03-29T20:08:03.000Z","_content":"\nI always feel networks and trees are the most \"humane\" visual encodings in the visualization world.
